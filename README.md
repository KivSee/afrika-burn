How it works?

The following modes are possible:
- Peacock noise - once in a while peacock noise and rest of the time just background.
- Soundless background: calm and party
- Songs: nyan, (?)
- Off

Peacock noise, calm, party and off are permenent and stays until changed. Song interrupt other mode, and when song ends the installation returns to the previous mode.
